## Why cordova  and React
Cordova is really simple to build cross platform mobile applications for any of your needs, this can be used to maintain a website and mobile application from same source code (and maybe transitioning later to react-native).  

## Installing
1. Install dependencies: ```npm i``` or ```yarn install```
2. Install global tools: ```npm install -g cordova```
3. Add your cordova platform by running ```cordova platform add %PLATFORM%``` (android and more)

## Build and run as application
As you do with any cordova application, ```cordova build android```, ```cordova run android``` and more.
